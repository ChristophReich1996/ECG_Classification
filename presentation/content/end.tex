    \textbf{Achievements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Presented the novel ECG-DualNet for ECG classification
        \item Proposed an advanced augmentation pipeline
        \item Performed extensive testing (against various beelines) including pre-training
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Observations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Highly overparameterized models (ECG-DualNet++ $130\si{\mega}$) does not overfit in the classical sense $\to$ Deep Double Descent \cite{Nakkiran2020} ?
        \item Spectrogram encoder is the most crucial part of ECG-DualNet
        \item Extensive pre-training on the Icentia$11\si{\kilo}$ does not lead to performance benefits on the target 2017 PhysioNet dataset
    \end{itemize}
