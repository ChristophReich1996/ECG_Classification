\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This work presented a novel deep neural network architecture for classifying AF in single-lead ECG signals with variable length. The introduced ECG-DualNet utilizes input data in the frequency and time domain. The time-domain ECG signal gets processed by a separate encoder. The resulting encoded latent vector gets employed in the spectrogram encoder by conditional batch normalization. We also extended ECG-DualNet by the use of Transformers and Axial-Attentions (ECG-DualNet++). With the use of both input data from the time and frequency domain, we were able to outperform a CNN baseline which only utilizes input data from the frequency domain.
