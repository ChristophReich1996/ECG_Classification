# ECG Classification

This repository includes the code of the ECG-AttNet for ECG classification. This work was done as part of the 
competition "Wetbewerb k√ºnstliche Interligenz in der Medizin" at TU Darmstadt.

## Installation

All dependencies can be installed by running the following commands:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/ChristophReich1996/ECG_Classification
cd ECG_Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd pade_activation_unit/cuda
python setup.py install
cd ../../
```

The implementation was tested [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/) 5.10.7 and CUDA 11.1. **To perform training and
validation a CUDA device is needed!** This is due to the PAU implementation, which does not support execution on the 
CPU. The functionality of this repository can not be guaranteed for other system configurations.

### Used Implementation

We implement ECG-AttNet in PyTorch
